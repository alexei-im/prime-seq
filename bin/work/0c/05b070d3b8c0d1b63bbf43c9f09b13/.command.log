AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> SRR001_1.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Illumina	2	AGATCGGAAGAGC	10000	0.02
Nextera	1	CTGTCTCTTATA	10000	0.01
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	10000	0.00
Using Illumina adapter for trimming (count: 2). Second best hit was Nextera (count: 1)
